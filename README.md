This is the Etch-A-Sketch project from TOP(the odin project) foundations course.

This project is about building a simple implementation of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my JAVASCRIPT knowledge.

Self-reflection and conclusion: This project was an opportunity to test my javascript knowledge.
